About this assignment, our group was assigned with a project to create a prototype for design thinking project. Therefore, we using face-to-face methods to discuss what problems are facing in our society today and after the discussion we conclued that the problem that people are addicted to mobile phones is getting worse. Through the process of this project, we decided to make a application called "Escape The Phone" that can help people to overcome and prevent this problem.

Comments

1. Uniqueness or difference when compared to similar products in the current market?

- if just use existing features on phones (samsung & iphone), only got warning alerts

- existing apps in stores (app store, google play store) only has the option to limit usage of certain apps

- our app has option to also shut down the phone or turn off the screen for a limited amount of time (around 10 - 20 minutes) according to the user's preference, as a way to let the user reflect on the amount of time they have spent staring on their phones.


2. If got important matters on phone during shut down, such as messages from family or from workplace?

- setting to either disable the shut down mechanics or shorten the duration when it shuts down

#### Reflection
In this lab, our group had hands-on experience of assembling a PC which is held at Makmal Inovasi(N28,level3A). During this class,I very enjoyed the process of assembling the PC and learned a lot of practical skills in PC assemble. By personally assembling the computer mainframe, I realized the importance of each component to the computer mainframe and learned some new knowledge about the internal parts of PC.
